Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way,
a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,
but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both
diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above,
a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. 
If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral
for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
